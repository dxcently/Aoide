# Copy to:  users/<name>.nix
# Then:     attach it from each host that wants it:

#               definition = ../../users/<name>.nix;
#               home.enable = true;
#             };
# Replace:  <name>, the groups, the shell, and the home floor.
#           `hashedPassword` below is a PLACEHOLDER. Generate your own with
#           `mkpasswd -m yescrypt`, or drop the line and use sops-nix
#           (`hashedPasswordFile`) — never commit a real hash you care about.

# are the account, applied in the host's evaluation for every host that attaches
# it, Home Manager or not; its `habit.home` is the home floor, and goes to this
# person alone, only when the host turns their Home Manager on.
